Some scripts to modify epub files:

1. Add margin around English characters and numbers when they are preceded and followed by Chinese characters.
2. Swap `<a>` tag and `<sup>` tag in html files within epub. To make it look better on the Kindle rendering.
3. Remove brackets around number in the content of `<sup>` to make it look clean.
